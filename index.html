        <h2>Hello.</h2>
        <p class="prof">
          I am currently studying to become a Machine Learning Engineer. I have some knowledge in C++, although my domain is Python which I use in Machine Learning. For the context of Machine Learning, I have adequate knowledge about supervised machine learning and it's related algorithms such as Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Gradient Descent, and Classification. I also have a limited knowledge of front-end (HTML and CSS) for the sake of web-scraping. I am open to learning and expanding my knowledge through experience.
